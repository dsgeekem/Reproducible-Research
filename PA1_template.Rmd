This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The variables included in this dataset are:

* steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
* date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
* interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

**Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
setwd("~/Data Science/Reproducible Research")
rm(list=ls())
data = read.csv("activity.csv")
```
**Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day**
```{r}
totalSteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = data, na.rm = TRUE, sum)

hist(totalSteps$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Taken Each Day"), xlab = "Steps Every Day", col="orange")

```

**Mean and median number of steps taken each day**

```{r}

mean(totalSteps$steps)

median(totalSteps$steps)

```

**What is the average daily activity pattern?**
```{r}
stepsInterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = data, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(stepsInterval$interval,stepsInterval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",main="Average Number of Steps per Day by Interval")

```

**Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, **
**contains the maximum number of steps?**
```{r}
stepsInterval[which.max(stepsInterval$steps), ]$interval
```
The following is the number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.  

```{r}
sum(is.na(data$steps))
```
Therefore, we will be imputing the missing values with the average number of steps per day/interval.
```{r}
replace_data <- transform(data, steps = ifelse(is.na(data$steps), stepsInterval$steps[match(data$interval, stepsInterval$interval)], data$steps))

newsteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, replace_data, sum)
hist(newsteps$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Taken Each Day"), col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps")

```

**New mean and median for imputed data**
```{r}

mean(newsteps$steps)

median(newsteps$steps)

```
Imputing the data with the average did not change the mean and only pushed the median up by 1.2 steps. 

But imputing the data with the average did push up the total number of steps by:
```{r}
sum(newsteps$steps) - sum(totalSteps$steps)
```

**The activity is different between weekdays and weekends.**
```{r}
library(lattice)

weekdays <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
              "Friday")
replace_data$dow = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(replace_data$date)),weekdays), "Weekday", "Weekend"))

newsteps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dow, replace_data, mean)

xyplot(newsteps$steps ~ newsteps$interval|newsteps$dow, main="Average Number of Steps per Day by Interval",xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",layout=c(1,2), type="l", par.settings = list(strip.background=list(col="lightgrey")))
```
